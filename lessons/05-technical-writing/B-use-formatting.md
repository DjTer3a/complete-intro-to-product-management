A simple hack to driving understanding is using formatting.

Very few people are going to read word-for-word everything you put in a doc unless they are either confused and trying to understand or they extremely interested in what you are saying. **Most people skim docs.** They look for headers and images to try to get the gist of your doc and its contents and they will spend additional time on parts of the docs that catch their interests. You, as the writer, therefore have the dual duty of making sure your reader finds the part that they want to find _and_ find the point you are wanting them to walk away with.

Enter formatting.

Unlike your essays in secondary school or the novels you read, you are under no restriction of using formatting in your docs. Use them often and tactically to make sure your users find both what they want and what you want.

Treat this more like web design than writing an essay.

## Use headings

The easiest is to establish visual hierarchies by using headings. A bigger text size, some bolding, anything that helps a user visual slice-and-dice your page into approachable bites. Help them decide "I don't want to read this" and "I need to read this" at a glance. If your designer is reading a product spec and sees "Kubernetes Configurations", they can decide at a glance they can very lightly skim that area or skip it all together. If the same designer sees "Results from our UX Study" they know they need to slow down and read that carefully.

## Bold and color are your secret weapons

Particularly when you are trying to get points across quickly **adding bold helps a lot**. It strongly attracts the eye and helps you make important details skimmable. Be careful to not _over do_ it as then the bold bits start to look the same as everything else.

Italics are less helpful from the perspective of helping skim but they are helpful from the perspective. They are more for adding a bit _emphasis_ to something so people can understand you are stressing a word or a phrase.

Adding color (red, green, etc.) can help and achieve similar effects. Just be extra cautious with it for two reasons: some colors can make it harder to read like a light green against a white background and that colors can mean different cultures. In American and much of Western culture, green means positive and red means negative. In China, Japan, and Korea those means are reversed, red means positive and green means negative.

## Long doc? Table of contents

Basically every word processor now allows you to add a dynamic table of contents. For really long docs I'd recommend it; it allows people to orient themselves and quickly get to the parts they want to. For short docs I'd leave it out as it's just noise for no benefit.
