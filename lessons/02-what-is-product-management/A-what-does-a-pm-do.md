title: "What Does a PM Do"
---

> When I type "PM" in this course, I mean product manager. However anyone with a job title that has the initials "PM" is equally entitled to use the initialism PM. That said, I _usually_ see it refer to product managers.

A really good first question to answer is "what does a PM do?" Throughout this course we will answer that but I will try to give you a brief overview first.

Before we do that, let's define some terms because "PM" can be confusing. Let's define first what a product manager is not.

> What each of these terms mean at each company varies so, so, so much. My title at Microsoft was "Program Manager" despite doing product manager work. "Product manager" isn't a title at Microsoft. So take each of these definitions with the appropriate "it depends on the company" grains of salt.

## Project Manager

A product manager is definitely not a project manager. Sometimes their jobs overlap (that depends a lot on the company) but the two's primary goals are distinct. A project manager's primary goal is to keep a team aligned on what work needs to be delivered when. They organize team sprints, hold status update meetings (frequently called standup or scrum), and update everyone with the status of the work. They are frequently certified scrum masters and specialize in organization and process to keep teams aligned, working on the correct thing, and oriented to delivering work on time and on budget.

This is a critical role in companies, particularly in large corporations. If you team does not have a dedicated project manager, it means those responsibilities are falling to someone else. It could be the product manager, the engineering mananger, the tech lead, or someone else, but driving alignment of work is a critical part of a healthy team. Treat these folks well; it is important work.

## Technical Program/Product Manager (TPM or PMT)

This title has more variance in it than project manager. A TPM can synomous with project manager, a product manager who works with techical tools (which would fit me), or a someone who works on cross-company processes. The last one there is what I tends to be the most common definition of PMT: it's someone who specializes in managing how teams work together. They will define how teams create dependencies on each other, how products and features get reviewed before they launch, and how big company-wide efforts are managed when there are many stakeholders involved.

Another critical role. While these imposed processes can feel like overhead, not having that overhead leads to disarray later which creates much more work than if you had just had some alignment before. The only thing worse than process is not having process. A good TPM can accelerate the pace of work for entire companies.

## Program Manager

This one is way less clear what it does and varies strongly from company to company. Microsoft calls all PMs, TPMs, etc. program managers and they perform duties contextual to their teams. Other companies call what you would normally call a TPM a program manager as they manage company-wide programs. My title at Microsoft was principal program manager and I did product management. The process-oriented engineering PMs I worked with had the same title as I did but did wildly-different work than I did.

## Product Marketing Manager (PMM)

Not as much applicable here but I wanted to call it out because the initialism PMM can confuse some. This is a title given to folks in marketing who work with product teams to create marketing plans for products and features. Some of this has strong overlaps with product managers as both roles care strongly "GTM" (go-to-market) plans: the plans you make of how you release products and drive interest in whatever you are releasing. I work a lot with PMMs are they are wonderful folks to have on your side: who care about your great product if no one is using it. Some companies (famously Apple) make the PMs do a lot of the PMM work themselves so it is useful skillset to acquire.

## Okay, so what is a product manager then?
