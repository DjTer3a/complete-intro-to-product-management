Congrats on finishing the course! 

Just to restate, you got a very biased take on how to PM from a very Microsoft, Stripe, and Snowflake perspective. I consulted other PMs to make sure I wasn't too off base but just know there are many correct ways to do this job. Some of this advice is the opposite of what _you_ should do as you will do this job differently than me and your company will work differently than how mine did. I truly did my best and I hope it helps!

Hopefully you enjoyed it and learned a bit about being a PM, either to improve your own skills as a PM or to continue your journey to become one. I hope you enjoyed the class and best of luck on your journey!
