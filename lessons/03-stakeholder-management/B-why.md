Why do we care about doing this first? Because we are building our product for our stakeholders and we need to be mindful that every product decision we make doesn't just affect the users we are targeting but has a ripple effect to all of our users. It can be okay to trade off making something good for one stakeholder at the cost of the another but the point here is to be intentional. Let's make some examples (again using Maps).

### Let's make more money

Let's say we get a directive from management that we need to pull in more money for Google Maps. Take a second here and think about some ideas you would do to make more money on Google Maps.

One idea is to increase the amount of sponsored listings on Maps. Frequently users will search for things like "coffee shop" or "italian restaurant" on Maps and Maps will show preferrential treatment to your business if you pay for it. So an easy path to more money is more sponsored slots. Instead of showing a max of 2 sponsored ads, we could show 5. Bam. Done. Free money.

But let's look at it from a stakeholder management perspective.

- We do help net-new businesses that pay for those listings
- We do harm businesses that were already being shown as sponsored listings; we have diluted the value of an ad by showing more than just 2. An ad now is less valuable and that harms people already giving us money.
- We do harm businesses that don't pay for those listings; when they would have otherwise ranked higher in a search they are being pushed down in the listings because someone paid to jump above it
- In theory, your ranking algorithm is giving back the best results for a user searching for a "coffee shop" but you actively presenting to them something your ranking algorithm has ranked as better. I think it's fair to say you are choosing to present an inferior user experience so you can make more money.

This is actually a real story from me this week. I was looking to buy a bottle of tequila as a gift for a friend on a popular grocery delivery service and so I search for "tequila" from supermarket. This particular service had apparently sold the "tequila" keyword to not just other tequilas (something that would be fine, it's tequila and which order you present them to me is a choice anyway) but to other types of alcohol like vodka, hard seltzers, and bourbons. I counted and of the 20 initial results, 50% were ads and 40% of all results were _not_ tequila but some other type of alcohol. It was a frustrating experience because I had to sift through a bunch of objectively wrong results to find what I was looking for. They sold me out as a stakeholder.

In this situation should you do it? I would argue it is unlikely to increase profits enough to justify how much it adversely affects other stakeholders, but you would need to assess how much it degrades user experience and how much it increases profit. The metrics matter here.

### Let's improve our API

TODO: if we improve our API we break other people's apps, degrade users' experiences, and force devs to rewrite integrations
